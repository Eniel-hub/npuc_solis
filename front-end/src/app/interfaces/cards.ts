    content : `In the beginning there was no earth or sky or sea or animals.  And then God spoke in the darkness:  "Let there be light!"  And right away there was light, scattering the darkness and showing the infinite space.  "That's good!" said God. "From now on, when it's dark it will be 'night' and when it's light, it will be 'day'."
    The evening came and the night passed and then the light returned.  That was the first day.
    On the second day, God made the earth and over it He carefully hung a vast blue sky.  He stood back and admired His creation.  "That's good too!" said God and the second day was over.
    The next morning God looked around and thought, "The earth needs to be a bit more organized."  So, He put all the water in one place and all the dry land in another.  When He had finished that, God made plants to cover the land.  Dandelions and daffodils appeared.  All sorts of trees and grasses began to grow.  "It's looking great," said God and that was the end of the third day.
    On the fourth day, God looked around and thought, "The daylight still needs a bit more work and the night is just too dark."  So, He made the sun to light the sky during the day and the moon and stars to add a bit of sparkle to the night.  He hung them in the sky and stepped back to look at his work.  "This is coming along very well,"said God.
    The next day, God turned his attention to the water he had collected in the oceans.  "I want these waters teeming with life!"  As soon as He said it, it was so.  In no time, there were millions of small fish darting through the shallow water and huge fish swimming in the ocean.  God made birds, too.  He sent them soaring through the air.  "Ahh, that IS good!" said God.  The dusk fell over the water and the sky grew dark and that was the end of the fifth day.     On the sixth day, God added creatures to the land. He made lions and tigers and bears.  He made rabbits and sheep and cows.  He added everything from ants to zebras to the land.  But He still felt something was missing.  So God added Mankind to enjoy and take care of all that He had created.  God looked around and was happy with all He had made.
    After six days, the whole universe was completed. On the seventh day God had a nice long rest and enjoyed looking at all He had made.`

    content : `God took some clay from the ground and made the shape of a man.  Then He breathed gently into the shape.  The man's eye's opened and he began to live.  God called him Adam.
    The Lord made a beautiful garden for him to live in.  The garden, called Eden, was full of many wonderful things.  Beautiful flowers grew everywhere.  Birds sang in the trees, streams flowed through the valley and animals roamed across the fields.
    God had made the man in His image to keep Him company and look after the world.
    God brought all the animals to Adam one at a time to be given their names.  "Elephant", he would say, or "Tiger", or "Porcupine".
    But God felt sorry for Adam.  "None of these animals is really like him," thought God, "he needs someone to share his life.  Someone who cares for him and who he can care for."
    That night, God took a rib from Adam's side and made a woman.  When Adam awoke the following morning, he found a wife, Eve, lying asleep beside him.  Adam was so happy.  He took her hand and she woke up.  She looked up at him and smiled.
    God told the man and woman that it was their job to take care of their new home.  God blessed them, saying, "All this is for you.  Help yourself to anything you like.  But never touch the tree in the middle of the Garden.  That tree gives knowledge of good and evil.  The day you eat its fruit, you will die."
    God did not mean that Adam and Eve would drop down dead the moment they ate the fruit from the tree.  He meant that in time they would die with out His Spirit dwelling in them.
    One day, Adam and Eve were gathering berries for dinner when she heard a silky voice behind her.
    "Has God told you that you can eat the fruit from all the trees?" the voice asked softly.  Eve turned around to see a snake talking to her.
    "God has told us we can eat all the fruit except for what grows on The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil," Eve told the serpent.
    "Oh come now, that's silly!  I hardly think such a lovely fruit would do you any harm," the serpent lied. "God knows that if you eat from The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil you'll become just like God, and will be able to decide for yourself what is right and what is wrong."
    The woman looked at the fruit and thought how tasty it looked. She thought how wonderful it would be to be as wise and powerful as God.  She believed the serpent's lie and ate the fruit and also gave some to Adam, who was with her, and he took a bite as well.
    She felt a strange feeling in the pit of her stomach.  She fidgeted and wondered what was wrong with her.  Suddenly she realized that she was feeling guilty -- she had disobeyed God and knew she'd done something wrong.
    As soon as they ate the fruit a change came over Adam and Eve.  They became unhappy and fearful of God.
    Adam and Eve heard God calling them.  Without thinking, they dived into the bushes, but God knew where they were.  When God asked them if they had eaten from The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil that He had told them not to touch, they blamed each other for their sins.
    God was sad that Adam and Eve had disobeyed them.  He told them that they had to leave the Garden of Eden, "From now on you'll have to scratch a living from the soil.  You'll need to make clothes and grow food.  Nothing will come easily -- not even childbirth.  And one day, you will die."`

    title : "Noah's Ark",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-3.JPG',
    content : `The story of Noah is amazing!  It includes a family, all the animals of the earth, a huge boat, a flood and why we have rainbows.
    It all starts with Noah.  Did you know that after Noah was 500 years old he had 3 sons?  I don't know about you but I've only met one or two people that were 100 years old and they were old!  After Noah was 500 years old things started getting very interesting for him.
    One day as God was thinking about the people on earth His heart became very sad.  He could see that all the people had become very bad, so bad that they stopped thinking of anything good.
    God was so sad and hurt that he wanted to get rid of every person and all the creatures that He had made.  He wanted all the evil to stop.
    The thing about God is that He gets very angry at our sin and all the bad stuff in the world but we also know that God is love.  God IS love, so that means that He can be disappointed when we do bad things but He still loves us, and that's why He remembered Noah.
    Noah was the only one that was righteous (which means that he did things right).  He was a good guy and he walked with God.
    So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all the people because the earth is full of fighting because of them.  I am going to destroy them and the earth."
    God then gave Noah instructions on how to make the boat.  He told him what kind of wood and how big to make it.  He also told him to put a door in the side of the ark and to make it with three floors.  The ark was humongous!  We'll get to that more later in the story.
      The Bible says that next God told Noah that He would make a covenant with him.  A covenant is an agreement with a promise.  He would save Noah, his wife, and his three sons and their wives.  They would be safe in the ark because God was going to flood the whole earth and everything else would die.
    I'm missing one other BIG thing that's going in the ark with Noah and his family... and that is...  The animals!  Two of all living creatures male and female (or the boy and girl of each).  Plus two of every kind of bird and every creature that moves along the ground.
    Then food for each of them for as long as they were on the boat.  Yikes!  That's a lot of animals and a lot of food.  I think it would've been a very full, noisy, stinky place to be, but they would all be safe.
    It's hard to describe how big the ark actually was but if you think of some of the biggest animals you know (elephant, moose, buffalo, giraffe, rhino, gorilla) and make sure you have 2 of each of those plus all the other little animals that couldn't be stepped on...they needed a lot of room!
    Some people think it took over 100 years to build the ark and the Bible says that Noah was 600 years old when the flood waters came.
    Keep in mind that Noah was building a big ark because God told him to.  I have a feeling Noah and his family were teased a lot from the other people.  What if your neighbor started building a huge boat on your street?  It would sound a little strange...
    When the ark was done God gave Noah 7 days warning before the flood to get all the animals and food on board, and told him that He would send rain for 40 days and 40 nights.
    When everyone was in the ark God shut the door.
    Then the rain started.  The Bible makes it sound like the rain came from the clouds and that there was also water coming up from the ground.  So everything probably was covered pretty quickly.
    The floods kept coming for 40 whole days!  The ark floated on the water and all the high mountains were completely covered with water.
    Every living thing died on the earth that wasn't in the ark.
    So the rain came for 40 days and nights but when it stopped Noah and the animals couldn't just leave the ark.  There was too much water and no land for them to walk on, everything was covered.
    The waters flooded the earth for one hundred and fifty days, which is about five months.
    God remembered Noah and all that was in the ark so he sent a wind to help dry the earth.  Finally in the seventh month after the floods had stopped the ark rested on the top of a mountain.
    A little while after that (40 days) Noah opened a window he had made for the ark and probably let in some fresh air!  Ha!  Even more importantly he let a raven out.  It would fly back and forth to the ark until the water had dried.
    Then he sent out a dove but the dove couldn't find any place to go.  He waiting a week and then sent the dove out again.  This time the dove came back with an olive leaf which meant the waters had gone down.  He waited one more week and let the dove out again and this time it didn't return.
    From the way the Bible describes Noah, his family and the animals were in the boat for just over a year or 370 days!  That's a long time to be on a boat with all those animals!
    When the earth had dried up enough God told Noah that everyone could get out of the boat.  That probably was a very happy day!  Maybe a little uncertain as well.  There would be no one but them on earth and they would have to start all over building a house, collecting food...there wasn't a big grocery store waiting for them when they got off the ark.
    The story of Noah's arkThen Noah built an altar to thank God for keeping them safe.  When God saw what Noah had done he told Noah that he would never again curse the ground even if people became very bad.
    Then he made his official covenant with Noah and with all the animals.  God would never bring a flood to kill all living creatures and destroy the whole earth again.
    Then he gave them a sign for everyone to see this promise.  He put a rainbow in the sky and that's to remind us of the promise God made to Noah, the animals and us today!
    So, whenever you see a rainbow say a little prayer and thank God that he loves us and that He keeps His promises.`

    content : `This story is about pride.  Pride is when you think you're better than someone else.  The problem with this, is that God hates pride.  When we think we are better than others we also start to think we don't need God and that we can handle things on our own.
    The thing is, we ALWAYS need God.  He made us so that we would need Him.  He wants us to depend on Him and ask Him for help.  If we think that we have everything figured out and that we know it all, then we're really going our own way and turning away from God.
    Just think about the last time you disobeyed your parents or you weren't nice to a friend.  You put your thoughts and feelings first and didn't care about how the other person felt.  That is pride.
    In this story you'll see how God handles pride and how badly he wants to stop it from happening.  It all started with a King named Nimrod.
    Everything was going great.  Everyone in the whole world spoke the same language.  Some of the people ended up living in a place called Babylonia.
    Then King Nimrod decided he wanted to be famous.  He wanted everyone to know him and how great he was.  He convinced the people that lived in Babylonia that, they too could be great if they built a tower that went all the way to heaven.
    So the people went to work making bricks for the Tower of Babel.  It was hard work but the people wanted everyone to know that they made the tower that reached heaven, so they just worked that much harder.
    The people also convinced themselves that by building the tower that would stay united.  Since they already spoke the same language, now they would be building the tower together.  Their pride had taken over and all they were thinking about was that they'd be known in all the world for building the biggest and best tower ever.
    God could see what was happening all along, but decided to come down to earth and see the tower the people were building.  God could tell the people's hearts were more focused on themselves and the tower than on him.  He was very disappointed and angry with them.
    God said, "I see that the people think they can do anything because they all speak the same language.  They have already begun to turn away from me and soon there won't be anything good left, all they'll do is sin.  I will mix up their language so they won't understand each other, this way they won't be able to work together to sin against me."
    After God said this the people could no longer understand each other.  It seemed like they were babbling and making funny noises.   All the people suddenly spoke different languages, some spoke French, some Spanish, others Chinese, plus many other languages.  They were very confused.
    This was the beginning of the languages.  Imagine what would've happened if the people didn't try to build the tower in the first place and they focused on God instead.  Maybe we would all speak the same language today.
    From there the Lord scattered the people all over the whole earth.
    It's interesting because when the people starting building the tower of Babel, Babel meant "gateway to God" but after God mixed up their language it meant "confusion".  Even the word babble that we use today is said to come from that day when everyone was babbling with confusion.
    So you can see how much God hates pride.  The people could've done amazing things for God when they all spoke the same language, and they could've been unified that way.  Instead they decided to do something silly and build a big tower just so other people would notice them and call them great.
    The opposite of pride is humility, or to be humble.  The way you can be humble is by realizing that EVERYONE (poor people, people with disabilities, people of different races, etc.) is special.  Each of us might be good at some things, but you can be sure that each person is special at something that you're not.
    If you want to be humble remember to listen to your parents and those in authority,  be kind to others instead of putting them down, and read your Bible and pray.  By doing these things you're not just focusing on yourself.
    After all pride just causes a lot of trouble!`

    content : `Once there was a man named Abram.  One day the Lord came to talk to Abram, and Abram asked, "Who will have all my things when I die".
    God promised Abram and his wife Sarai that one day they would be parents, even though they were old and had no children.
    God wasn't sure that Abram understood.  So that night He took him outside, and said, "Do you see all the stars that are in the sky"?  When Abram looked up, the whole night sky was full of stars,  so many in fact that he would never be able to count them.  Then God said, "That is how many children you will have".
    Quite a few years later when Abram was ninety-nine years old (older than even your grandparents)  the Lord decided to change Abram's name to Abraham, which means "father of many."  He also changed Sarai's name to Sarah.
    God told them again that they would be parents and that they would have a boy.  This time Abraham laughed so hard he fell on his face!  It was hard to believe that he and Sarah would have a child in their old age.
    One day three visitors came to Abraham's house.  He hurried to meet them.  "May I get you something to eat and drink?"  Abraham asked.  "Please come in and join us, and have a rest on the couch."
    The visitors agreed, so Abraham brought them some fresh bread, milk, and hamburgers.
    While the visitors were eating, they asked Abraham, "Where is your wife Sarah?"  Abraham thought this was a little  strange, but he replied, "She's in the other room".
    Then one of the men spoke and said, "I will come back to see you at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."
    Now Sarah was listening behind the living room door.  She started to laugh, but covered her mouth and laughed to herself because she didn't want to be heard.  Then she said to herself, "How can I have a child, I'm almost one hundred years old?"
    Abraham and Sarah Bible children's storyLater when the visitors had left,  Abraham and Sarah realized that the man who had told them this was indeed God.
    A year later Sarah did have a son.  She and Abraham named him Isaac, which means "he laughs."
    They were very excited, and remembered to thank God for Isaac.`

    title : "Joseph's Story",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-6.JPG',
    content : `This is the story about a young man named Joseph.  His father's name is Jacob, and they lived in Canaan from where his grandfather was from.
    Joseph was seventeen (old enough to drive a car these days), and he had eleven brothers; and only had one brother younger than him.  Can you imagine having eleven brothers to play with, or fight with?
    Children's version Bible story:  Joseph and His Coat of Many ColorsBecause Joseph was one of the youngest sons, his father spent more time with him, and he became very special to him.  So Jacob had a special robe made for Joseph.  (They didn't have jackets back then, so this was a very special jacket).  It was very beautiful and had every color you could imagine in it.
    All of Joseph's older brothers saw this and they got very jealous.  The word jealous means that Joseph's brothers disliked him because they thought his father liked him more, and because he got the special coat.  They got so jealous they couldn't even say a kind word to him.
    One day Joseph had a dream, and he went to go tell his brothers.  He said, "Guess what?  Last night I had a strange dream.  We were tying up bunches of grain out in the field when suddenly my bunch stood up, while all of yours gathered around and bowed to me."  The brothers looked at each other in disgust, but Joseph continued.  "Then I had another dream that the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me."
    "Who do you think you are?"  The brothers said.  "Do you think that you are better than all of us?  Do you think that we would ever bow down to you?"  This made the brothers dislike Joseph even more.
    When he told his father about his dreams he said, "Those are strange dreams."  But he thought carefully about  what Joseph had told him.
    A few days later Joseph's father asked him to check on his brothers.  They were in the fields quite a distance away.  So Joseph went to find them.
    When the brothers saw Joseph in the distance, they made a plan to kill him.  But when Reuben, Joseph's oldest brother heard this he said, "Let's not kill him, just throw him in a well out here in the field."  He said this because he was secretly planning to come back and rescue Joseph when the other brothers had left.
    So when Joseph came to them, they took off his beautiful robe and they threw him in an empty well.  A little while later a group of people came by that were wanting to sell some things in Egypt.  One of the brothers spoke up, "Why don't we sell him to these people, this way we never have to see him again, and we don't have to kill him."
    The other brothers liked this idea, so they sold him to the people who were going to Egypt.
    Unfortunately Reuben had been working and hadn't seen what happened.  When he returned to the well he noticed that Joseph was gone.  He had been sold to an important man named Potiphar, an assistant to the Pharaoh of Egypt.
    The rest of the brothers took Joseph's beautiful robe and dipped it in animal blood and took it back to their father.  When the father saw this he cried, "Some animal has killed my son."  And he cried for many days, so much that nobody could comfort him.
    Now Joseph had started out as a slave, but the Lord was with Joseph and He helped him do everything right.  So Potiphar made him his helper, and put him in charge of everything that he owned.
    The problem came when Potiphar's wife lied about Joseph to her husband, so Potiphar had Joseph put into jail.
    The Lord was still with Joseph in jail, and the warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners.  He never worried because the Lord was with Joseph and helped him do everything right.
    After Joseph had been in jail for some time a cupbearer and baker to Pharaoh had been sent there.  One night each of them had a dream.  They told their dreams to Joseph and he told the cupbearer that he would soon be let out of jail.  "Please tell Pharaoh about me, and ask him to get me out of here."  Joseph said.
    When the cupbearer was freed he forgot about what Joseph did.  So Joseph stayed in jail for two more years.  Until one day the Pharaoh had a dream, and nobody could explain it to him.  The cupbearer then remembered what Joseph had done for him, and Joseph was brought to Pharaoh.
    "Can you understand dreams?"  Pharaoh asked.  "I can't, but God helps me."  Joseph replied.  After Pharaoh had told him his dream Joseph explained, "God is warning you.  There will be seven years when nothing will grow and there won't be any food for anyone."
    "What can I do?"  Pharaoh asked.  "God has shown you what to do.  There will be seven years before the bad years that will be very good.  So good that there will be extra food for everyone.  So you should save a little bit  of each years harvest, that way you will have enough to get you through the bad years."  Joseph said.
    Pharaoh believed all that Joseph told him, and put him in charge of all the land of Egypt.
    People came from all countries to buy grain from Joseph, because the whole world was in need of food.  Some of those people were Joseph's brothers.  When his brothers came, Joseph recognized them, but they did not know who he was.  (It had been over 10 years since they had seen him).
    The brothers all bowed to him because he was an important person.  Just as he dreamed they would at the beginning.
    After a few meetings with his brothers he could not keep it in any longer and Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph!  Is my father alive?"  But his brothers couldn't answer him because they were afraid.  Then Joseph said, "Come here.  I am your brother, the one you sold!  Do not worry, and do not be angry at yourselves for selling me, because God has put me here to save people from starving."
    So his father, his brothers, and their families came to live in Egypt with Joseph, and they had all the food they needed.`

    content : `Do you remember the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors?  This story takes place many, many years after Joseph - actually it happened about 200 years later!
    The people who were from the family of Joseph were called Israelites or Hebrews.  As it happens there were more and more Israelites than ever before.  The Israelites had children, and their children had children and soon there was too many to count.
    Most of the Israelites lived in Egypt where there were also a lot of people called Egyptians.  Too bad they couldn't all just see each other as the same.  But as you'll soon find out the Israelites and the Egyptians were treated very differently.
    Anyway, a new king who was called Pharaoh came into power in Egypt.  He didn't like it that there were so many Israelites and he thought they would one day take over the land.  So he decided to make all the Israelites into slaves.
    He made them work from early in the morning till late at night doing very hard work.  Even if they were tired the Egyptians wouldn't give them a break, they would just make them work harder.  It was very bad.
    Pharaoh did all this and he still wasn't happy.  The Israelites were still growing in number so he decided to make a law.  If any boys were born to the Israelites he would have them killed.
    At this time there was an Israelite couple who were expecting to have a baby.  When they had a baby boy  (whose name would later be Moses) they decided to hide him because they wouldn't let anyone kill this beautiful, precious baby of theirs.
    Children's Bible Story: Baby MosesThey hid Moses for three months, but as he got older he didn't sleep as much and he cried louder than before.  So his parents did the only thing they could do, they made a strong basket (sort of like a mini baby boat) and put blankets around the baby and placed the basket in some tall grass in the Nile river.
    Baby Moses had a sister named Miriam, and she watched from a distance to see what would happen to her baby brother.  While she was watching she saw somebody coming, she realized it was Pharaoh's daughter and her servants.  They were dressed like they were famous, and she had seen her before and remembered what she looked like.
    Pharaoh's daughter had come for a swim.  While she was swimming she noticed a basket floating a little ways away in the tall grass.  So she asked one of her servants to go see what it was.
    The girl brought the basket over to her, and when Pharaoh's daughter opened it, the light startled Moses so he woke up and started to cry.  "What a sweet, beautiful little baby.  It must be one of the Israelite's,"  Pharaoh's daughter said to her servants.
    Miriam had seen what had happened, and she hurried over and asked, "Would you like me to go find an Israelite woman to feed the baby for you?"
    "Yes, go and find someone who can nurse the baby."  she answered.  Miriam ran as fast as she could and told her mother that Pharaoh's daughter had found him and wanted someone to come nurse him.
    They went and found Moses with Pharaoh's daughter, and she asked them, "Please help me and nurse this baby, and I will pay you for helping me."  (She didn't realize that this was actually Moses' mother).
    Later he became the son to Pharaoh's daughter, and that's when she named him Moses, which means she got him out of the water.`

    content : `When Moses and his brother Aaron got to Egypt the Lord told them what to do.  He said, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him to let the Israelites go.  He will be very stubborn and it will take many signs and miracles before he will let you go; but everyone will know that I am God when he finally frees the Israelites."
    So they did what God asked and they went to see Pharaoh.  In front of Pharaoh Aaron threw down his staff and it became a snake (just as God told Moses it would).
    Pharaoh didn't look surprised at all, he actually just smiled at Moses and Aaron.  Without a word he snapped his fingers and a minute later three men walked in.  Pharaoh whispered in one of the men's ears, and he nodded and spoke quietly to the others.
    All at the same time they threw the staffs they were carrying to the ground and they became snakes, just like Moses and Aaron's.  They turned and looked at each other with disappointment.  They realized that these men were Pharaoh's magicians.
    Just as Moses was feeling defeated his snake swallowed up all of the other snakes.  This made Moses smile, surely Pharaoh would let them go now.  But Pharaoh didn't seem to care, he shook his head and said, "Nice try, but the Israelites belong to me, and they work for Egypt I will not let them go."
    Moses left disappointed, but excited to talk to God about what they would do next.  After all God told them that it wouldn't be easy.  So when God spoke next, they listened well, "Pharaoh's heart is hard, he's still not going to change his mind.  Go see him tomorrow morning, he didn't listen today but I will continue to show him that I am God."
    With their instructions from God, Moses and Aaron met Pharaoh the next morning.  Aaron explained to Pharaoh, "Because you still won't listen God is going to change all the water in Egypt into blood.  The fish will die, the river will stink, and none of the Egyptians will be able to drink it."
    The Story of Moses and the PharaohPharaoh smiled and said, "Go ahead."  So Aaron did what the Lord told him and put his staff into the water and it turned to blood.  Pharaoh seemed a little surprised but he summoned his magicians and they also turned the water into blood. With that, Pharaoh's heart became hard, and he turned and walked back to his palace.
    All the fish died, and the water smelled so bad, no matter where you were you could smell it.  Can you imagine turning on your tap at home and having blood come out, what about having a bath, or even the water in your toilet.  Of course the Egyptians didn't have sinks and toilets back then, but they still used water to drink, to make food, and to clean with.
    After a whole week of this Pharaoh still wouldn't let the people go.  But his magicians couldn't turn the blood back into water either.  The Lord instructed Aaron and Moses to go see Pharaoh once again and He told them, "Tell Pharaoh to let my people go.  If he refuses to let them go, I will plague the whole country with frogs."
    They did as God asked and Pharaoh once again refused to let the people go.  So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered everything.  They really were everywhere!  In the stoves where they cooked, in their beds, and they even jumped on the people.
    The magicians could also make frogs appear - but this would be the last time that their magic would work.  After a day of this Pharaoh couldn't take it anymore and he called for Moses and Aaron.  (He probably didn't get any sleep with frogs jumping all over him!)
    He begged Moses, "Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go."  So Moses prayed to the Lord, and all the frogs died.  But when Pharaoh saw that all the frogs were dead, he was relieved and he hardened his heart and changed his mind.
    There were many other plagues that followed:  Gnats and flies, all the livestock got sick and died, the Egyptians were covered in sores, hail came down and killed all the crops, locusts came and ate all the grass and everything green, and then there was complete darkness.  Nobody left their homes because they couldn't even see where they were going.
    With each of these plagues Pharaoh said he'd let the Israelites go if God put things back to normal, but then he kept changing his mind.  You'd think he would've learned his lesson and let the Israelites go.  God doesn't give up.
    You may have felt sorry for the Israelites during all these plagues, but God made sure they were not touched by them.  Only the Pharaoh and 'his people' the Egyptians went through these terrible times.  The Israelites lived a little ways away, and God kept them safe, and put a pretend wall around them so none of the plagues could come to them.
    If you thought all the other plagues were bad, there was one last plague (the tenth plague) that was way worse than any of the others.  The Lord told them, "This will be the last plague on Pharaoh and Egypt, after this they will let you go.  Around midnight I will go throughout Egypt.  Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, even the son of Pharaoh, and there will be great sadness."  Moses and Aaron warned Pharaoh, but he refused to listen.
    The Lord had special instructions for Moses and Aaron, so that the Israelites would be sure to stay safe during this last plague.  He told them, "The Israelites must kill their best sheep or goat.  Then they are to take some of the blood and smear it on the sides and tops of the doors on their houses.
    On that same night I will pass through Egypt like a ghost and take the life from every first born.  If I see blood on the doorway that will be a sign for me to pass over the house and keep all who are inside safe.
    This day will always be known as the Passover, because you were passed over and kept safe by God.  You will continue to celebrate this day for many years."  (Some people still celebrate it today!)  They were also to eat unleavened bread (bread that is flat, not fluffy like we eat it).  This would always remind them of the hurry that they left Egypt in.
    Now you have to remember Pharaoh could have stopped all this a long time ago.  God gave him many opportunities to let the Israelites go, but he would not listen.  Unfortunately God had to teach Pharaoh a lesson and He did what He said He would do.
    After Pharaoh realized what happened in Egypt he called for Moses and Aaron just after midnight and he said, "Leave my people, you and all the Israelites!  Go worship the Lord as you wanted, take all your animals and get out of here!"  The Israelites gathered up gold and silver from the Egyptians who were glad to see them leave and they left with Moses.
    You won't believe what happened next!  When Pharaoh heard that the Israelites had left he changed his mind- again!  He decided to gather an army of more than 600 people and go after Moses, Aaron and all the Israelites.
    So as the Israelites were on their way, they noticed in the distance that Pharaoh was coming after them.  They started to get worried and questioned Moses why he would lead them out in the desert to die.  Moses knew what to say, and he told them, "Do not be afraid, God has protected you before, He will protect you again."
    When the Israelites reached the Red Sea they were trapped with the Sea in front of them and Pharaoh behind them.  But God told Moses to reach out his staff into the water, and when he did an amazing thing happened.  The water split into two!  The water lifted itself and made huge walls of water (they couldn't even see over it, it was higher than a house).  They would walk on dry ground, which was actually the bottom the Sea.
    Pharaoh's army followed them into the Sea, even though some of the Egyptians were afraid, and knew God was with them.  When the Israelites had finally made it through safe God told Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the water goes back to normal, and it will swallow up Pharaoh and his army."
    Moses did as God had told him and he reached his staff over the water.  There was a loud crash as the water came back together, and covered the Egyptians.
    That was the day the Lord saved the Israelites from the Egyptians.  When the Israelites saw what God had done for them they trusted Him, and they knew that Moses would be a good leader for them as they traveled to the land flowing with milk and honey.`

    title : "God Gives The 10 Commandments",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-9.JPG',
    content : `The Israelites had been traveling in the desert for about 3 months (which is a little longer than regular summer holidays) when they came to Mount Sinai.  They were going to stay there for a while plus they had excellent shelter from the mountain.
    Moses got unpacked and decided to walk up the mountain to talk to God.  Remember that this wasn't very easy for Moses, he was already over 80 years old.
    God knew that Moses was coming so He spoke to Moses and told him to tell the Israelites to get ready.  Moses came down to tell the people to have a bath and to clean all their clothes.
    By doing this the people were getting prepared to hear important words from God.  That is why we sometimes dress up or make sure we have clean clothes on when we go to church.  It makes us hopefully behave a little nicer and shows respect to God.
    On the third morning after Moses had talked to God, the Israelites where busy making their breakfast when all of a sudden there was a large rumble and a flash of light over the mountain.  Anyone who was still sleeping were startled and woke up suddenly.
    Everyone went out to look and just over the mountain there was lightning and thunder, and a very thick cloud hung over the mountain so you couldn't see the top.  Even the mountain shook and the sound of trumpets could be heard getting louder and louder.
    So Moses went up the mountain to hear from God once again.  This time God told Moses, "Go down to the people and tell them not to follow you up the mountain, the mountain is a special place because I am here."  So Moses warned the people not to touch or go to close to the mountain.
    Children's Bible Stories: Moses and the Ten CommandmentsAfter that Moses went back up the mountain.  But this time he stayed there for a long time (40 days and 40 nights), God sure had a lot to tell him.  God wanted to instruct the people on how to live.  By following His rules they would have less sadness in their lives.  God just wanted to protect them.
    It's just like when our parents give us rules to protect us: to look both ways before we cross the street, to not hit our brother or sister...  They give us rules because they love us and know what's best for us.
    We'll just talk about the first ten commandments God told Moses, otherwise we might be here for 40 days and we don't have time for that.  Besides, the 10 commandments are the most important for us right now.   Remember as you hear each commandment that they are all equally important, one is not more important than the other.
    The first commandment is to put God first.  This means that nothing should be more important than God - a hobby you enjoy, tv or video games, even your friends and family should not be more important than God.
    The second command is to worship only God.  This is like the first commandment in that God wants our love, and He doesn't want us to bow down and worship a statue just because we can't see Him.  In other words God is the only one that we should pray to.
    The third commandment is broken all the time.  God commands us to use His name with respect.  Many people use God's name like a swear word, or say it when they're upset.  God wants us to use His name when we're talking to Him, or telling others about Him in a nice way.  To use His name in these other ways is very disrespectful and hurts God to hear it.
    The forth commandment should be easy, we are to remember God's Sabbath.  God wants us to take one day of the week and rest.  When God made the world in six days, He rested on the seventh day.  This gets harder when you get older, there always seems to be something to do, but remember God commands us to take a day off.
    The fifth commandment might be a little tricky for some of you, but its very important (like all the other commandments) that you follow it.  He tells us to respect our parents.  Sometimes you might think you know what's best, or you get frustrated because your parents won't let you do something.  Remember your parents were once kids just like you, and they are trying to keep you safe and from making the same mistakes they've already made.
    Which commandment is next...oh right, it's the sixth commandment.  This commandment says don't hurt others.  Now imagine for a minute if everyone in the whole world obeyed this rule like God wants us to.  We probably wouldn't have any jails and we would all get along with one another.
    The seventh commandment is for those who are married.  God tells us to be faithful in marriage.  He wants us to love our wife or husband someday (even if they get on your nerves once and a while) and treat them with respect.
    The eighth commandment is don't steal.  This means that we shouldn't take something that doesn't belong to us.
    We are almost done, the next commandment is don't lie.  It is always better to tell the truth, and while you're at it don't do anything that would make you want to lie.  Usually parents know when you're lying anyway, and if you don't get caught God sees and hears everything and He knows.
    The last commandment is don't be envious of others.  This means that we shouldn't wish to have things that someone else has.  I know there is always a new toy or game - there is always something that we want to get.  It's important to remember that these things aren't really important.  God is the most important (if you remember the first commandment).
    Now I know this list might seem impossible to follow all the time.  I know that I don't follow all these commands all the time, and I'm going to pray to God and ask His forgiveness and try to do my very best to not do it again.
    Another thing to remember is that if you disobey a commandment God sees the smallest lie just the same as if someone hurt someone really bad.  I know sometimes we think if we just told a little lie it wouldn't matter or God wouldn't notice, but it does matter and God does notice.  It makes Him sad when we disobey Him, so when we make a mistake we need to say sorry to God and to the person you've wronged and try to be a better person next time.`

    title : "God Calls Samuel",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-10.JPG',
    content : `This story is about a woman named Hannah who really really wanted to have a child.  Every year she would go with her husband to a place called Shiloh.
    While they were there, there would be a big festival and everyone would celebrate all that God did for them.  They would thank God for their crops and everything God gave them, and give sacrifices or presents to God to show how thankful they were.
    This sometimes made Hannah very sad because she wanted so badly to be thankful, but was discouraged because she couldn't have a child.  That didn't mean Hannah moped around and felt sorry for herself but in her heart she was very sad.  Her husband still loved her very much and tried to make her feel better but nothing seemed to work.
    Finally Hannah did the only thing she knew that she could do to help her situation.  One evening when they had finished eating and drinking Hannah went to the temple and began to pray.
    Children's version bible stories:  Hannah's PromiseWhen Hannah prayed she was very honest with how she was feeling.  She sometimes cried a lot and probably felt like God had forgotten her.  But while she was praying she promised God, "Dear God, if you would only look and see how sad I am and remember me, please give me a son.  If you would do that for me I will dedicate my son to you for his whole life."
    As Hannah was praying there was a man named Eli, a priest, who was sitting nearby and saw her.  While Hannah was praying she was praying to herself, her lips were moving but Eli couldn't hear her say anything.  We can pray just like this to if we need to,  we can pray to God in our head so no one can hear.
    Eli realized that Hannah was being very honest and truthful with God and he said to her, "Go in peace and may God answer your prayer."  After that Hannah left she felt much better because she had talked to God about what bothered her.  Early the next morning she even went to worship God before she went home.
    You see, sometimes God doesn't answer our prayers, but we can't just be mad forever and not talk or thank God for all the other good things in our life.  God knows what's best so there's always a good reason why he hasn't answered your prayer.
    But a while later a great thing happened.  God of course remembered Hannah (because God doesn't forget any of us) and gave her a son, and she named him Samuel.
    Hannah had waited so long for this child and she loved him so much, but she remembered that she made a promise to God.  Hannah was an honest woman and when she made a promise she meant it.  Again, Hannah had a good attitude and wanted to give Samuel back to God, she wasn't mad at herself and change her mind.  Hannah kept her promise.
    When Samuel was old enough she went back to the place where she had prayed and said to Eli the priest, "Do you remember me?  I am the woman that cried and prayed for this child and He answered my prayer.  Now I give him to the Lord and I will leave him with you to learn and work with you."
    So Samuel lived with Eli and every year Hannah would pack her suitcase and visit him and bring him new clothes.  It might have been hard for Hannah to see Samuel only once a year but she wanted to keep her promise.  God blessed Hannah again and gave her and her husband even more sons and daughters.
    Samuel did very well while staying with Eli.  Then one night something unusual happened.  Eli and Samuel had both gone to bed and were having a nice sleep.  When Samuel all of a sudden woke up, someone was calling him, "Samuel."
    Well, Samuel thought it was Eli so he ran to his bed and answered, "Here I am; you called me?"  But Eli said, "I did not call you; go back and lie down."
    So Samuel went back to his bed.  He didn't know this, but God was calling him.  Just as Samuel got settled God said, "Samuel!"  And Samuel jumped up and went back to Eli and said, "Here I am, you called?"
    Again Eli answered, "No I didn't call you; go back to bed."
    The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli again and said, "Here I am; you called me."
    Eli couldn't figure out what was going on.  He had been thinking who could be calling Samuel, they were the only ones there.  Suddenly Eli realized there was only one other explanation so Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if you hear the voice again, say, 'Yes, Lord, I'm listening.'"
    Sure enough, Samuel went to lie down and the Lord called again, "Samuel!  Samuel!"  So Samuel quickly replied, "Speak Lord, I am listening."
    From then on Samuel knew when God wanted to talk to him and he always listened.  God blessed Samuel and he grew up to be a great prophet or spokesperson of the Lord.
    So Hannah did the right thing when she kept her promise to God.  Her son Samuel helped many people know God better.`

    title : "Samuel Searches David",

    content : `Saul had been king, but he kept disobeying God so God asked Samuel to find a new king.  God said to Samuel, "Go to Bethlehem and there is a man named Jesse with eight sons.  One of them will be the next king."
    When Samuel first met the sons he automatically thought that the oldest son named Eliab would be the king that God had chosen.  But the Lord said to Samuel, "Do not look at the way he looks or how big he is.  Eliab is not the one I have chosen, the way he looks doesn't matter to me, I look at the heart."
    Jesse brought more of his sons to meet Samuel but none of them God had chosen either.  Samuel asked Jesse, "Have I met all your sons?"  Jesse replied, "I have one son left named David, he's the youngest, and he's out looking after the sheep.  I will bring him here to meet you."
    As soon as Samuel saw him the Lord spoke to him and said, "He is the one."  So Samuel anointed him with oil which was a special way of promising him that he would be the next king.  And from that day on the power of the Lord was with David.
    David continued to take care of his father's sheep in the fields.  When he didn't have much to do in the field he played instruments, and wrote songs and poems that you can find in the book of Psalms in your Bible.
    Meanwhile Saul was still king and he ruled people called Israelites.  David and his family were Israelites too.`

    title : "David Kills Goliath",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-12.JPG',
    content : `The Israelites weren't getting along with people named the Philistines.
    The problem with the Philistines was that they had many giants living in their land.  One of the strongest and biggest giants was named Goliath.  He was over nine feet tall, which is taller than any person recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records.  He would've had to bend way down to get through a regular door.
    Goliath was covered with armor to protect him and carried a big spear.  Every morning and every evening for forty days he shouted to the Israelites in his big deep voice, "Hey, you guys!  I dare you to find one man to fight me.  If he can beat me we will become your servants, but if I win you will all become our servants."
    When Saul and all his men heard this they were very afraid.  Three of these men were David's three oldest brothers.  They were the only ones in David's family that could go fight because they were old enough.
    Now David's father Jesse heard about the giant and was worried for his sons.  He called David out of the fields and asked him to take some food to his brothers and report back how they are doing.
    So David set off to visit his brothers.  As he approached them he heard Goliath shouting his challenge like he did every morning.  "Isn't someone going to stand up to this man?"  David asked the men in the army.  "Then I will fight this giant Philistine."
    One of the men overheard this and ran to Saul and told him what David said.  Saul approached David and said, "You can't fight Goliath, you're only a boy and he has been fighting for many years."  But David said to Saul, "I have had to fight lions and bears to protect my father's sheep.  God helped keep me safe then and he will help keep me safe now."
    It was too bad that Saul the king wasn't trusting in God to help him,  he didn't know what to do to beat Goliath.  Then this young boy named David came and he knew in one day exactly what to do, and trusted that God would help him.  That's why God loved David's heart and wanted him to be king.
    David and Goliath children's version Bible storySo Saul dressed David in heavy armor to protect him from Goliath but David took it off.  It was so heavy he could hardly walk and he knew that God would keep him from harm.  Instead David went to a stream nearby and found five smooth stones, put them in a pouch around his waist, and with his sling he went to Goliath.
    As David approached Goliath, Goliath looked at David and thought it was a joke.  Goliath thought that he could easily beat David and it was funny that Saul would send a small boy to fight him.  But David said to him without fear, "You fight with a sword and I come with God on my side and today everyone will know that there is one true God in this land."
    Goliath didn't care what David said and he moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly to meet him.  Reaching into his pouch he pulled out a stone, put it into his slingshot and shot it at Goliath.  The stone had hit him right between his eyes and suddenly Goliath started to loose his balance.
    He fell with a loud thud right on his face.  David had done it, he beat the giant Philistine!  When the rest of the Philistines saw this they ran away and David became a hero to all the people in Israel.`

    Solomon also built large temples for God because he loved God. He was a justice-loving king who always did justice to others. Whoever comes to him will get justice.
    One day two women came to King Solomon crying, one of whom had a small newborn child. Seeing both of them crying, Solomon asked them, “What happened to you two? What is the reason that you are crying so much?”
    The first of them said, “King, you help us and I hope you will do justice to us. This is my son and this woman is saying that he is her son. You should decide that Whose son is it. “
    “King, his son was born today but he was dead. My child was born on this day. She snatched my living child from me and started telling him as her,” another woman said.
    The king was confused on hearing this. He started thinking who among these two is speaking the truth and who is lying? After this, the king figured out an idea.
    He ordered his soldier, “Soldier come here and bring that child to me. Now you cut this child into two equal pieces and divide these pieces among those 2 women.”
    On hearing such a thing of the king, people were thinking that why the king ordered to cut the child? The reason for this was that he would die after cutting that child.
    When the king gave the order, the first woman started saying that this decision of the king is absolutely correct. She agrees to do so. On the other hand, the other woman started crying loudly. She said that the king should not do this, so it is better that he should give this baby to her.
    The king noticed the gestures of the two women and after that, he understood who the real mother of that child was? The king orders, “The other woman is the mother of that child. Give that child to her and the first woman should be in jail.”
    Seeing the understanding of the king, the whole public was pleased. They said that they had found a sensible king and justice-loving king. This is why many people came to Solomon to ask for justice`

    title : "The Prophet Elijah",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-15.JPG',
    content : `This story is about a prophet named Elijah.  Elijah was a regular man who made mistakes, who was afraid sometimes, yet when it really mattered he trusted God.  Elijah did amazing things with God's help and God did amazing things for Elijah.
    A few things you should know before we start the story is that the land of Israel where Elijah was going was very evil.  There was a king named Ahab who believed in a god named Baal (the weather god).   He and most of the people worshipped this god and did many things that the Bible says we shouldn't do.
    King Ahab also had a wife named Jezebel.  The king and his wife both came from very evil families.  Together they helped make Israel a place that God did not like.  That's why God sent Elijah, he would show the people that God was more powerful and the one they should be worshipping instead.
    It all started when Elijah was told by God to deliver a message to King Ahab.  Elijah went to Ahab and told him, "My God has told me that there will be no rain or even dew in the next three years until I tell it to."  I'm going to guess that Ahab didn't believe this would happen because he worshipped Baal who was the lord of the weather and he should've been able to give rain whenever the people prayed for it.
    Now just think for a second if you had no rain, snow, or even dew for three years.  Rivers and lakes would get very small or dry up completely.  Since that's where we get our water from we probably wouldn't be able to have baths or flush toilets anymore.  Getting a drink of water  wouldn't be as easy anymore, we might only be allowed to have one cup of water a day.
    Elijah's prayerAfter Elijah told King Ahab what would happen the Lord told Elijah to go and hide.  And while there would be no rain and not much food in the land, God made sure Elijah had what he needed.  He stayed by a brook where there was water for him to drink and a type of bird called the raven, brought him bread and meat for breakfast and supper everyday.  Neat, huh?!
    After some time passed, the brook that Elijah was drinking from dried up and there was no more water to drink.  So God told Elijah to go to a place called Zarephath, there he would find a lady who would give him food and water to drink.
    So Elijah trusted God and did just what he said.  When Elijah got to the entrance of the town he saw a woman there gathering wood.  He asked her, "Would you please bring me a little water in a cup so I can drink and a small piece of bread?"
    She replied, "I believe in God as you do, but I don't have any bread to eat, just a small amount of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug.  I was just going to go home and make the rest of the food for me and my son and then we will probably die because we will have no food left."
    Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid!  Go home and make the food for you and your son, but first make a small loaf of bread for me, and bring it to me.  The Lord has told me that if you do this your jar of flour will never go empty and the jug of oil will not go dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land."
    So, she went home and did as Elijah had told her and everyday there was food for Elijah, the woman and her son.   Imagine trying to empty a glass of water and it never goes empty.  This was another of God's amazing miracles.
    Everything was going fine until the woman's son got sick and died.  She went to Elijah for help, she thought God was punishing her for all the mistakes she had made.  So Elijah rushed over to her house and said, "Give me your son."  He took the boy in his arms to the room upstairs where he was staying.  Then he cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, please let this boy live again!"
    Elijah spread his hands over the boy and cried out to God like this three times.  The Lord heard his cry and the boy began to breath.  Elijah picked up the boy and took him back downstairs to his mother and said, "Look, God answered my prayer, your son is alive!"
    As the woman hugged and kissed her son she said to Elijah, "Thank-you!  I know that the Lord is with you and whatever you say is true."
    Now, if you think that is a cool story, that's only the first half!  God has much more in store for Elijah.  Elijah still has to show the people of Israel, King Ahab and Jezebel that Baal isn't God.  Elijah doesn't know how he's going to do this, but God has it all planned out.
    Over three years had gone by without a drop of water from the sky.  Animals were starting to die because they had no water or food.
    Also during this time the evil Jezebel was trying to get rid of all the prophets of God like Elijah (a prophet is like a mailman,  they send messages from God so we can know what he wants us to do).  What Jezebel didn't know was that one of the king's servants named Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace, was hiding the Lord's prophets in caves to keep them safe.
    God spoke to Elijah and told him, "Go to Ahab and I will send rain."  So Elijah went to find Ahab.  When Ahab was told that Elijah wanted to see him he said in an an angry voice, "Is that you Elijah, the troublemaker of Israel?"
    Elijah quickly replied, "I am not the troublemaker.  First your father and now you have disobeyed God over and over again.  You stopped following his commandments and have followed Baal.  Now send for all the people of Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel.  Bring all the prophets of Baal and the false prophets of Jezebel."
    None of us should disobey God, but God was especially mad because Ahab and his father were both kings.  Kings had a lot of responsibility like presidents and prime ministers.  They made laws and people listened to them, and when the King and Jezebel ruled Israel they didn't worship God they worshipped Baal, and unfortunately a lot of the people turned to Baal like they did.
    All the people gathered on Mount Carmel.  Elijah stood before the people and said, "How long will you keep changing your mind?  If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him."  The people just stood there and said nothing.
    Then Elijah said to them, "This is what we're going to do.  I am the only prophet of the Lord left and Baal has over four hundred.  Get two bulls, let them choose the one they want and I will take the other one.  Cut it up and place it on wood, but do not start the wood on fire.  I will do the same.  Then you call out to Baal and I will call out to the Lord.  The god who listens and starts the fire is the real God."
    All the people nodded and agreed.  So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Get a head start and get your bull ready first.  Call on Baal, but do not start the fire yourself."
    So they picked the best bull and set it on the wood.  Then they began calling on Baal to start the fire.  They shouted and danced around the altar yelling to Baal to start the fire.  They shouted and shouted from morning till noon with no answer.
    Around noon Elijah was getting bored but he said to the prophets of Baal, "Maybe you're not shouting loud enough.  Maybe your god is busy or sleeping and he can't hear you, you better shout louder."
    So some of the people ran around screaming to Baal, others were bowing and crying to Baal.  They just couldn't seem to do enough, but nothing happened.
    The people who believed in Baal had done this all day long and they were very tired.  Finally, Elijah called the people over to his altar.  He began to make his altar.  He took some stones and put them around his altar.  Then he built a trench around his altar to hold about a bath tub full of water.  Then Elijah did something very strange.  He asked the people to pour water over his bull, the wood and enough water to fill the trenches below the altar.
    How was God going to start a fire when the whole altar was soaking wet?  The people started to giggle and thought for sure that Elijah's God would never be able to start a fire now.
    After the entire altar was completely soaked Elijah stepped forward and simply prayed: "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, show us today that you are the real God of Israel and that all I have done is obeyed you.  Answer me Lord, so that these people can believe in you once again."
    Just as Elijah finished his prayer and everyone stood silently watching, fire burst out of the altar and everything was covered in flames.  Every single thing was burnt down to nothing, and all the water was gone.
    As the people watched completely amazed they began to fall on their knees and cry out, "The Lord, he is God!  The Lord, he is the real God!"
    Then all the prophets of Baal were taken away and Elijah told Ahab to watch because now that the people didn't worship Baal anymore, the Lord would let it rain.
    Then Elijah went back to Mount Carmel and prayed to God that the curse would be over and that rain would come.  While he was praying he asked his servant to go look towards the sea for a rain cloud.  The servant came back and said, "There is nothing in the sky Elijah."
    Elijah asked him seven times to keep looking, and the seventh time the servant came back and said, "This time when I went to look there was a very small cloud, as small as a man's fist coming this way."
    Elijah said to the servant, "Run to Ahab and tell him if he wants to get to his palace in Jezreel he'll have to leave now, the rain is coming."
    Meanwhile, the little cloud grew bigger and bigger and the sky got darker and darker.  The wind started to blow and it began to pour and pour and pour... and the drought was over.`

    content : `The story of king Josiah start when his father, King Amon, was killed when Josiah was 8 years old. So, Josiah was 8 years old when he became the king of Judah! He was a king for 31 years in Jerusalem. He was faithful to God.
    During the 18th year of King Josiah's reign, he told Shaphan the scribe to go to the temple. King Josiah wanted the money counted that was brought into the temple by the people. King Josiah wanted the money to be given to the workers that were working on the temple. There were carpenters, builders and masons that were doing repairs to the temple. King Josiah told them not to worry about counting the money the workers were taking, because they were all honest.
    Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.”  After they read it, Shaphan took the book of the law to King Josiah. He told the king that they had gathered the money for the temple and delivered it to the workers doing the repairs.
    Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.  When the book of law was read to King Josiah, he tore his clothes! King Josiah told several people to ask about this Book of the Law that they found. He said God has a lot of anger because we have not obeyed His words in the book.
    They went to see Huldah the prophetess, and she told King Josiah's men that God has said that He would bring a disaster on this place because they were not following God and they were worshipping idols.
    But, because King Josiah was so upset and humble towards Me when he read the book of law and King Josiah is trying to find God's answers, God said He would not send the destruction during King Josiah's time. God would send the destruction of Judah after King Josiah died.
    King Josiah had everyone assemble at the temple. He read the whole Book of the Covenant to all the people that had been found in the temple.
    Then King Josiah stood by a pillar and made a promise to God. King Josiah said he would follow the Lord and keep His commandments and God's laws with his whole heart and soul. King Josiah said he would follow and do the laws that were written in the book. All the people agreed to follow the Book of the Covenant from God.

    King Josiah commanded that the idols that were in the temple to be brought out and he burned them in the fields outside of Jerusalem. He removed the priests that worshipped the idols.
    King Josiah had all the shrines, altars, everything that had to do with idols taken down and burned or broken so it couldn't be used ever again. Not just in the temple, but everywhere that he could! There were a LOT of idols!

    content : `This is the story of how Daniel went to Babylone.
    Jehoiakim was in his third year as king of Judah. King Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon, and he went to Jerusalem, and he conquered the city of Jerusalem.
    King Nebuchadnezzar took some items from the temple, too.
    King Nebuchadnezzar told his eunuch to bring some of the young men of the land for three years of training. They had to be good-looking, smart, quick to learn and would have the ability to serve the king.
    After the training, they would serve the king.
    Some of the young men that were chosen to be taken to Babylon were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. The chief eunuch changed their names to:
    Daniel = Belteshazzar
    Hananiah = Shadrach
    Mishael = Meshach
    Azariah = Abednego
    The king provided some of his delicacies to eat and wine, with 3 years of training for each of them. Daniel didn't want those foods to eat, he asked the steward that was put in charge of the young men for vegetables and water for 10 days.
    The steward asked Daniel why Daniel would ask such a thing! If Daniel and his friends looked bad, and the other young men looked better, then the king would be upset with him! His own life would be in danger!
    Daniel said to look at them after the 10 days to see if they looked better and were healthier than the young men that eat what the king provides for them. At that time, the steward could make a decision based on how healthy everyone looked. Of course, they looked better and healthier, so the steward gave everyone the vegetables.
    At the end of the training period, they were taken before King Nebuchadnezzar.  The king interviewed them and there wasn't anyone like them! Because of that, they were chosen to serve the king. And the things like wisdom and understanding, they were ten times better than the king's men. `

    title : "The Dream Of The King",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-18.JPG',
    content : `During the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he woke up from a dream. The dream worried him so much that he couldn't go back to sleep. King Nebuchadnezzar 'gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams.'
    They all came and stood before King Nebuchadnezzar. He told them that he had a dream and he really wanted to understand what the dream meant. The Chaldeans told the king to tell them the dream and they would interpret it. But the king replied and told them they had to tell him the dream AND explain it! They told King Nebuchadnezzar that there wasn't anyone on earth that could tell him his dream! No one could do that except the gods (small g), and they didn't live on earth!
    This made the king so angry that he gave the command to kill all the wise men! So, the order went out and they were even looking for Daniel and his friends to kill them also!
    Daniel saw Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, and asked him what was so urgent, and Arioch told Daniel what had happened and why the king was so angry. Daniel went to the king and asked for time to interpret the dream. King Nebuchadnezzar gave Daniel the time and Daniel went to tell Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego why the king was so upset. They did not want to be killed like the rest of the wise men!
    God explained to Daniel what the kings dream was and what it meant during the night in a vision. Daniel praised God and thanked Him for revealing what he needed to know about King Nebuchadnezzar's dream.
    Daniel went to Arioch and asked him not to kill any more wise men and to take him to the king. Daniel said he had the answer and could interpret the king's dream.
    Daniel went to the king and explained that God in heaven has given Daniel the answer to the king's dream. Daniel told the king what his dream was, then Daniel told King Nebuchadnezzar what the dream meant.
    King Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel that God was the true God. Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon. (Daniel 2:48)
    Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.`

    title : "Daniel In The Lion Den",

    content : `This is a story about Daniel.  He actually came to Babylon with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and each king that came and went liked these men because they were honest and hard workers.  They were always given the most  important jobs which made the other workers of the king jealous.
    This time the king's name was Darius and he also liked Daniel.  He knew that Daniel was a good worker so he decided to put Daniel in charge of the whole country.  The other servants of the king were very jealous of Daniel and they tried to find something that would get Daniel in trouble.  They were trying to get him fired, but Daniel obeyed God so they couldn't find anything.
    Finally these men said to each other, "We can't find any reason for the king to fire Daniel.  The only way we could get him to disobey the king is if we made a law against his god."  So they went to king Darius and said, "O great king, you are so wonderful that no one should pray to anyone but you."
    The king said, "That sounds like a great idea!"  Then the men continued, "All of your workers have agreed that this should be done and that anyone that prays to any other god should be thrown into the lions den."
    The workers lied and said that everyone who worked for the king agreed, but of course they never talked to Daniel because they knew he wouldn't agree.  The king didn't know this, so he made the law and it couldn't be changed.
    When Daniel heard about the new law he did what he always did.  He went home to a room upstairs and opened the windows that looked out over the city.  Three times that day he went down on his knees and prayed to God just like he always had.
    These men went as a group to Daniel's house and found him praying and asking God for help.  So they ran straight to the king and told him, "Your worker Daniel is ignoring your command.  We have seen him praying to his God three times today."
    When the king heard this he was very sad.  He really liked Daniel and he didn't want him to die.  He tried everything to get the law changed to stop Daniel from being thrown in the lions' den, but the men came to him and reminded him that the law could not be changed and Daniel would have to be punished.
    So at the end of the day the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den.  The king said to Daniel, "I hope your God who you serve and pray to will rescue you!"
    A large, heavy stone was rolled in front of the den and the king went back to his palace with tears in his eyes.  That night King Darius couldn't eat or sleep he was so worried for Daniel.
    Daniel and the lions children's version bible storyThe next day, as soon as the sun came up the king got up and ran to the lions' den.  As he got closer he shouted, "Daniel, has your God who you serve and pray to rescued you from the lions?"  The king waited quietly for a response.
    Then all of a sudden Daniel said, "O king, live forever!  My God sent an angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions.  They have not hurt me because I have done nothing wrong."
    The king jumped with joy and immediately ordered that Daniel be removed from the den.  And when Daniel was lifted from the den, there wasn't even a scratch on him because he trusted in God.
    The king knew that the men had tricked him into punishing Daniel so he punished them.
    After that the king made a new law and he said, "Daniel's God is great, and I order that everyone in my kingdom must respect the Lord God, who rescued Daniel from the hungry lions."`

    title : "Esther's Story",
    img: '../../../assets/imgs/flashcard/flashcard-20.JPG',
    content : `"Please don't make me go," begged Esther.
    "You must, Esther. Every girl in the kingdom to enter by order of the king," her cousin Mordecai explained. Esther's parents had died when she was young and he had raised her ever since.
    Esther crossed her arms and said, "I'm happy where I am. I certainly don't want to be a Queen. Besides, I'm Jewish and the King isn't.  There are lots of Persian girls entering the beauty contest ' they don't need me."
    "You have to enter and that is final. Besides, there are so many girls entering, you likely won't be chosen anyways," Mordecai assured her. "And when you go, I don't want to hear about you pouting. I know what a lovely person you are and I want to make sure you stay that way."
    The girl smiled and hugged the man, unable to refuse him for long, "All right, Mordecai. For you, I will go cheerfully."
    Mordecai smiled gratefully and then frowned slightly, "Esther, wait.  There is one last thing you must promise me."
    "Yes?" said Esther, somewhat concerned by the serious look Mordecai had taken.
    "You must not let ANYONE know that you are a Jew. Do you understand?"
    She nodded sadly, "Yes, I understand."
    When Esther was falling asleep that night, she began to think about what it would be like at the palace. She'd have to spend an entire year there, away from family and friends, before the King would even choose his new bride. "Ah well," she thought, "at least I'll get to return home after that. After all there's no way the King would end up picking a peasant, Jewish girl as his Queen ' no matter how lovely people thought she was." Esther shivered even though it was a warm evening.
    The next morning, Esther packed her bags. She was happy that her cousin would be able to visit her quite often as he worked at the palace as a minor official. Esther carefully combed her long dark hair and gazed longingly out the window. She'd miss the sights and sounds of her home and wanted to commit every detail to memory.
    Mordecai walked by, stopped and turned back. "You look so thoughtful Esther," he said with a smile.
    Esther nodded. "I hope I'm not chosen to be the Queen. I prayed all last night that God would make the King choose someone else."
    "Esther!" Modecai chided, "You mustn't pray only for what you want, but for what God wants of you."
    Esther looked confused and Mordecai smiled gently. Sometimes he forgot how young she still was.
    "What I mean is," he began again, "that God may not always give us what we want, but he does provide us everything we need. You can't just ask for what you want all the time, because it might not be what God wants. So you must ask for what God wants."
    Esther thought a second and responded slowly, "But ' I don't know what God wants. How can I pray for something I don't know?"
    Mordecai said, "Well, you could simply pray, 'God, I want whatever you want. I put my trust in You.' Do you understand?"
    "I think so ...does that mean, instead of saying, 'God, please don't let the King choose me for his queen,' I am to say, 'God, if you want me to be Queen, then I will be happy with your decision.  Please help me do my best to be a good one'?" Esther asked.
    Mordecai smiled and kissed Esther on the forehead, "That sounds perfect."
    The year passed quickly, but Esther missed her home every day. Just as she'd promised Mordecai, she did her best to remain cheerful and kind. And every night she prayed that God would help her do His will.
    Esther didn't like the way some of the other girls teased each other and tried to be kind to everyone she met. She'd been placed in the care of a man named Hegai. Because of her gentle nature Esther became friends with him. Hegai placed Esther and her servants in the best room in the palace and brought her small gifts.
    Twelve months passed and it was time for Esther to go see the King. As Hegai led the beautiful girl to the King's palace, people stopped to stare at Esther's gentle beauty.
    "Esther, do not be afraid of the King," Hegai said to her as they neared the throne room.
    When they had reached the throne room, Esther took a deep breath and knelt before King Xerxes.
    "Dear God," she prayed silently, "give me the strength to do Your will."
    The King gazed down at Esther. "My goodness," he thought, "this one is young. She's very beautiful, but I don't know'"
    It was at that moment that Esther finished her silent prayer. Without thinking, she raised her head (something she shouldn't really have done without the King's permission, but it was her habit when she'd finished her prayers.) The look on her face was so serene, it increased her beauty ten-fold ' and the King's heart was hers.
    He broke into a wide smile, happy that he'd finally found his bride, "What is your name?"
    Esther realized her error, bowed her head and looked at the floor. "Esther, my lord."
    "Esther, it's alright you can look up now," said the King. She looked up at his smiling face and blushed slightly, which pleased him too.
    "You have a beauty beyond all beauty. Beauty of the flesh and of the heart!" he exclaimed.
    King Xerxes beckoned to Hegai, "This woman, Hegai, shall be my Queen. You have cared for her well, and her beauty surpasses all others, inside and out. Thank you."
    Hegai nodded and said, "You are most welcome, great King, I am honored to be of service to you."
    Xerxes then called for a servant to bring Queen Vashti's old crown. He took it and placed it gently on Esther's head. "You, Esther, are now my Queen."
    Mordecai sighed and leaned against the inside walls of the castle. He missed Esther but was happy to be able to see her almost every day. He was saddened that she had to hide the fact that she was a Jew from the King. It was all so dangerous for her' and she was so young. What if...
    Mordecai shook his head. "It is not good to think of such things," he thought to himself. "Esther will be fine."
    Low voices close by startled him out of his reverie.
    "No, that's too long to wait and far too public a place," said another voice. "It is best to do it while he is sleeping.  Perhaps we could bribe one of the servants."
    Mordecai peeked around the corner and saw the men standing there. His eyes widened when he recognized two of the King's men, Bigthan and Terish. He flattened himself against the wall for fear of being seen and continued listening as they finalized their plot to kill King Xerxes in his sleep the following night.
    As soon as it was safe, Mordecai rushed to see Esther.
    "Mordecai, you must have misheard. Bigthan and Terish are the King's men. Why in the world would they want to do something like that?" Esther argued
    "I know it sounds impossible, but it is what I heard. You must warn the King right away," Mordecai urged.
    Esther frowned, "But what if we're wrong.  The King will think I'm a foolish young girl with an over-active imagination!"
    Mordecai thought a moment. "Perhaps," he said thoughtfully, "but won't you risk looking a fool to save his life?"
    Esther nodded, "You're right, Mordecai. I will tell him immediately."
    When Mordecai had left, Esther hurried through the outer gardens toward the palace courts. Reaching the King's throne room, Esther adjusted her crown and smoothed her skirts.  This was IMPORTANT business! She walked in quietly but quickly and made her way to  King Xerxes' throne. Esther bowed and the King took her hand.
    "What is it, my Queen?" he asked.
    Esther rose and said, "Terish and Bigthan are plotting to kill you, my lord."
    The King frowned. "How do you know this, Esther?"
    "Mordecai, my cousin, heard them talking at the gate.  They plan to bribe your servant and kill you tomorrow night while you sleep."
    The King leaned forward and asked, "Are you sure of this?"
    "Yes, your majesty," Esther replied solemnly.
    King Xerxes then called over several guards and told them what Esther had said.  The guards were immediately dispatched to find the servant, who fearfully confirmed Esther's story (he didn't think it too wise to lie to the King when questioned directly about the plot).
    "Thank you, Esther. You've saved my life," King Xerxes said, looking at Esther with a smile.
    Returning his smile, she said, "You're welcome, but it is really Mordecai's doing, sir."
    "Please give him my thanks, and thank you for coming to me without delay."
    "You're welcome, your majesty." Esther bowed and left quickly.
    Meanwhile, Mordecai sat outside the palace gates watching the people run around, doing their various activities. Just then a loud trumpet was blown.
    Mordecai looked down the road to see several men carrying another man in a tall chair.  It was Haman, a court official. Mordecai frowned.  Haman always made people bow to him, but Mordecai never did -- he bowed before God and no other. When Haman passed by him, Mordecai sat quietly, only looking at the ground. Soon he looked up again when he heard the other man pass by.
    Haman was FURIOUS! Mordecai's refusal to bow made him furious. Didn't he know how important Haman was!
    "I'll get RID of him then," Haman thought with a wicked grin on his face. "Better yet, he's a Jew, miserable lot.  I'll get rid of every one of them!" He chuckled at the thought as he and made his way towards the palace.
    He marched into the throne-room and bowed with a flourish. "Your majesty," he said importantly, "it has come to my attention that there is a group of people in this land that do not respect you or your laws.  They are a bad example for your other subjects and must be dealt with before they begin to plot against you and cause discontent throughout the entire kingdom."
    "Who are these people?" King Xerxes demanded.
    Haman bowed low and said, "My Lord, they are the Jews."
    King Xerxes was infuriated at the thought that there was another plot of some sort brewing in the kingdom.  Perhaps it was these Jews who had turned Terish and Bigthan against him!
    Haman could see he had the King's attention and quickly added, "Your majesty, I have a plan to get rid of them."
    The King nodded, and, taking his signet ring off his finger, handed it to Haman. "Do with the people as you wish," he said solemnly.
    Haman bowed and scurried quickly out of the room. "Ha, ha!" he chuckled with glee. "I've got Mordecai now! He'll wish he had kissed my very feet!" Haman immediately issued a decree that every Jew in the land would be put to death on the 13th day of the 12th month.
    When the news reached Mordecai, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went out into the city, wailing loudly. In every place to which the decree of the King came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay on sackcloth and ashes.
    Esther soon heard the mourning and crying outside the palace and sent two servants to find out what was wrong. When the servants came back, they had a message from Mordecai.
    "Queen Esther, Mordecai says that King Xerxes has signed a decree that says every Jew must die on the 13th day of the 12th month," said Hathach. "He wants you to go to the King and get him to change the law," the other man said.
    Esther put her hands on her head and began pacing back and forth. "But it's been 30 days since I was last called by the King. If I go to his throne room without being asked to, it will be me who is put to death."
    Esther awoke from her sleep that night with a start, "Perhaps God wanted me to become Queen to stop the Jews from being put to death! Why else had she been chosen Queen?"
    The next morning, Esther said to her servant, "Go now and tell Mordecai to get all the Jews together and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days. I too will fast and when it is done, I will go before the King, even though it may mean my death."
    Esther leaned against the door outside the throne room and sighed heavily. This was going to be even harder than she'd thought. She was weak from her fast and very scared at the prospect of the King's wrath. But she pushed her hair out of her face and took a deep breath.
    The king looked up angrily. He hadn't invited anyone to come to the throne room that morning. Why couldn't people understand how much work it was to run a kingdom. How dare they interrupt! Why he would'
    But he softened as soon as he saw Esther's beautiful face. He could see how scared she was and she seemed quite a bit paler than usual.
    A broad smile spread across the King's face. Esther almost fainted with relief when she saw that the King would forgive her for her interruption.
    "What is it that you wish, Queen Esther? Whatever you want, you will get, even if it is HALF my kingdom," King Xerxes said with a welcoming smile.
    Esther swallowed and said in a rush, "My lord, if it please the King, would you and Haman come to a banquet I have prepared for you both today?"
    King Xerxes smile widened. Why the pretty young thing missed him! Yes, it had been sometime since he'd seen her.  The King turned to his aides and said, "Tell Haman to hurry and get ready that he may do as Esther has said."
    So the King and Haman came to Esther's banquet. King Xerxes knew Esther wanted to ask some sort of favor of him, so he asked her again what it was. "My Queen, what is it that you wish for? I will give it to you, even if it means HALF my kingdom."
    Esther answered, "Please come with Haman to another banquet that I shall prepare for you tomorrow.  Then I will tell you what it is that I want."
    Haman was proud that he had been invited to both banquets - he and no one but the King - but, as he was leaving the palace, he passed Mordecai outside the gates.  Not only did Mordecai refuse to bow, but he didn't even stand up when Haman passed.
    When Haman returned home he was absolutely fuming. He paced back and forth, complaining bitterly about the nerve of Mordecai the Jew. How dare he not show Haman more respect.
    Then Haman's wife made a suggestion. "Make a gallows seventy-five feet high and tomorrow ask the King for permission to hang the man! Then you'll be able to enjoy the Queen's banquet in peace."
    Haman was SO pleased with this suggestion, he had the gallows made that very evening.
    That night, the King could not sleep. He called to his servants to bring him the history book telling of the most important events of his reign. As the servants read to the King, he noticed the item about how Mordecai had saved his life, for he had been the one to tell him about the plot through Esther.
    "Stop! Wait a minute!" King Xerxes commanded. "How has Mordecai been rewarded for this?"
    "My lord, I don't believe anything has been done for him," they replied to the King.
    The next day, Haman went to see the King to ask permission to hang Mordecai, not knowing that Mordecai had once saved the King's life.
    Hearing some whispering in the outer court, the King asked, "Who's there?"
    "Haman is here," replied the servants.
    "Let him come in," said King Xerxes.
    When the King saw Haman, he immediately asked, "Haman, what should be done to the man I want to honor?"
    Haman smiled, thinking selfishly, "Why, of course, the only man King Xerxes could be talking about is me!" So he answered, "Send the King's robe, the King's horse, and the King's crown, to one of the King's MOST noble princes, and let them dress the man in your robes, put your crown upon his head, and lead him throughout the city on your horse, proclaiming to all the people, 'SEE HOW THIS MAN IS HONORED BY THE KING!'"
    Then King Xerxes smiled with much pleasure. "I knew you'd have a good idea Haman.  Now hurry and take these robes of mine, get my personal horse and do as you have said to Mordecai the Jew that sits at my gate. Do not fail to do ONE thing of all that you have said!"
    Haman did his best to hide how shocked and angry he was at the king's command, but it wasn't easy.  The very man he wanted to hang was going to be HONORED by the King - with all these things he himself had suggested!
    Haman relunctantly dressed Mordecai up in the King's robe and crown, and led him through the city on the King's personal horse shouting, "THIS MAN IS BEING HONORED GREATLY BY THE KING!"
    Afterwards, Mordecai returned to his post at the gates, and Haman hurried home in despair. He poured out the story of how the King honored Mordecai over him at his VERY suggestion, and he cried bitterly. His wife and his friends could do nothing to comfort him.
    While they were still talking, a few of the King's messengers came to the door. "We are come to bring Haman at once to the banquet Queen Esther has prepared." Haman hastily straightened his hair and dared not let on the way he was truly feeling.
    Haman met the King at the palace, and, together, they headed for the second banquet with Esther the Queen.
    "What is it that you want, my Queen? What is your request? Whatever it is, I will give it to you, even if you desire half my kingdom," the King repeated when everyone had settled.
    "If the King is pleased with me, I request that the King will save my life and the life of all Jews. We face death soon. I and all my people are to be killed; every one of us must die."
    King Xerxes became very angry. "Who would dare touch you or any of your relatives?"
    Esther looked directly at Haman and pointed. "This wicked Haman is our enemy."
    Haman was so eaten up with envy, he tried to destroy an entire people just to get to one man - Mordecai the Jew!
    Now Haman turned white as a ghost with fright.  The King got up from his seat and stormed out of the room into the palace garden.
    As soon as the King went out the door, Haman quickly left his seat and went over to Queen Esther, begging for his life desperately. He knew the King was ready to have him slain for the evil he had planned to carry out on the Jews.
    By the time the King returned, Haman had thrown himself upon the Queen, begging for mercy. Seeing this, the King yelled and servants came running to hold Haman back from the Queen.
    "Why not hang him on the gallows he built for Mordecai?" someone suggested. The King sat back at the table and nodded. "YES!" he spoke with authority. "HANG HIM THERE!"
    And that is the way Haman died, for, in the end, Haman's jealousy cost him his life. He was hung on the gallows he had built for Mordecai.  Peace was restored to the kingdom. Esther and her people were safe because Esther was willing to go before the King, even if it cost her her life.`

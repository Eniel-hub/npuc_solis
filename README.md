# SOLIS-APP

The North Philippines Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists (NPUC) has a total of 158 elementary and high school with over 8000 students. To effectively manage those schools, students, and faculty and staff, NPUC’s IT department develops system and applications that are used by the administrators of the school  to facilitate them in their task. However, the said systems are not web based and in such it is difficult for them to use it everywhere they would like. They are also not directed to the student and so the enrollment of each student is still done through the window and not on an online platform. An online application was then needed to help students and administrators during the enrollment process by bringing it as close to them as in their own phone or computer. SOLIS is an application that has for objectives to address those flaws, being a web application, it is accessible to everywhere and it is student centered, providing to parents an easier enrollment process that can be done directly from their phone or laptop. Version 1.0.0 is only focused on the enrollment process of the student as well as the actions that can be taken by the administrator or registrar’s office.
